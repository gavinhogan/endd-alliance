<span class="section-title">INTRO</span>

The Marshall Guard (MG) is our primary team exercise. We run this multiple times a week to practice coordination and measure our total power. Typically, the exercise will happen 30 minutes after server reset.

Everyone online MUST participate. You will lose many troops, but do not worry. Leadership (Knight Commander Cal) tries to schedule these to minimize the impact of these losses—for example, by avoiding times right before "Buster Day." The rewards you earn will compensate you for your losses. Stay chill about losing troops!

- 🕒 **Time:** The exercise typically starts 30 minutes after reset and always lasts 30 minutes.
- ⚔️ **Squads:** Start rallies with your 2nd (weaker) squad. Join rallies with your 1st (strongest) squad.
- 🚫 **No Other Rallies:** All other rallies (like Zombies) are prohibited during MG.
- 🏥 **Healing:** Heal in 30-minute batches. Do NOT use speed-ups.
- 🤝 **Help:** Hit the "Help" button constantly for your teammates.
- ⚠️ **Heads Up:** The game will always say "Defeat is Certain." This is true for everyone and you will be defeated… proceed anyway.

    <h3 style="color: #fff; font-family: var(--font-heading); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 8px;">The Strategy</h3>
    <p>To deal maximum damage, your strongest squad must fight as much as possible. If your 1st squad starts a rally, it sits idle for at least 3 minutes. Instead, use your 2nd squad to start a rally to "hold a spot" for others to join with less wait time. Use your 1st squad to join the rally that is leaving the soonest.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #fff; font-family: var(--font-heading); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 8px;">Healing and Help</h3>
    <p>Constant healing is required. Only heal small batches of troops (30-minute timers). Click the Help request button as soon as your batch starts. If everyone clicks the "Help" icon constantly, your troops will heal for free in seconds. This keeps our alliance's total damage high.</p>

    <p>You should be at the alliance hive. If you are far away, you might be removed from rallies to save time. If you cannot teleport back, you should skip the exercise.</p>

<span class="section-title">TIPS AND TRICKS</span>

- 🛰️ **Scouting Buff:** Scout a random, unaligned base (one with no alliance) before the MG starts and again at the 15-minute mark. This gives you a 1% damage boost.
- 👑 **R4/R5 Buff:** Rallies led by R4 or R5 members give a damage boost. This is most effective when our stronger squads join these rallies but the buff works for everyone.
- 💪 **Keep Attacking:** Even after we "beat" the MG (Level 5), continue to attack. This increases your personal rewards.
- 😎 **Stay Chill:** If you are removed from a rally (especially if you are far from the hive), do not get upset. Just join the next available one.
