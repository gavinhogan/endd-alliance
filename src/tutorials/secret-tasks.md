<span class="section-title">I. INTRODUCTION</span>

Secret Tasks are found in the “**Jeep**” menu. These missions are an excellent source of rewards and are key to your progress in the game. Secret tasks are also a key mechanism for strengthening our server overall at the cost of other servers! By following this guide, we maximize our rewards and strengthen our server by taking resources from our enemies.

- 🟠 **UR (Ultra Rare) Are Vital:** Use the "Refresh" button until you see **UR (Gold)** tasks (or **SSR (Purple)** tasks if you are low on diamonds).
- 💎 **The Investment:** Spending diamonds to refresh for a Gold task is profitable for you. A Gold task pays back much more than you spend.
- 📅 **VS Saturday:** On Saturdays, the UR Golden Rule is **MANDATORY**. Only send Gold tasks. Gold tasks give the massive VS points we need to win the duel.
- 🤝 **Assists are Great:** When you assist another another commander, you help hide the task from plunder. In return you get a reward that costs them nothing.

Plundering is how we take wealth from other servers and move it to Server 2143. Unlike trucks, tasks are **not defended** by troops. This makes them the perfect opportunity to steal from the rich. Trucks are easier to find, but tasks are more impactful.

- **Target Other Servers:** Travel to an enemy server and look near their **Capitol**. That is where the high-power players with Gold tasks are located. Note: During an inter-server battle you will want to plunder on the specific server we are up against.
- **The "Perfect Zoom" Technique:** If you zoom out too far, tasks disappear from the map. Zoom in too close, and it takes too long to find them. Once you find a task, use it to set your zoom level to the maximum height where it is still visible. This is the fastest way to scan the enemy map.
  <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; border-left: 2px solid var(--accent-color); padding-left: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">Hunting on the PC version of the game is a huge benefit… if you can, take advantage of this.</p>
- **The Task Level:** Every task has a number under it. The higher the number, the better the prizes. High numbers belong to powerful enemy commanders—remember the Robin Hood rule: we steal from the rich to help the poor..
- **The "One and Done" Rule:** A task can be plundered **once per commander**, up to a maximum of **three commanders** per task.
- **Gotta Get'em All:** Be sure you get your 5 daily plunders. It can be a bit tedious, but the gains are worth it.
- **Focus on Gold:** Only use your plunder attempts on **Gold** tasks. While you might sometimes dispatch a Purple task, only ever plunder the Gold tasks.
- **Share the Wealth:** If you find a Gold task on an enemy server with available plunders, **share it to alliance chat** so your teammates can take the rest.

<span class="section-title">IV. SERVER 2143 ETIQUETTE</span>

- 🚫 **Internal Plundering:** Never plunder anyone on our own server (2143). We do not steal from our neighbors.
- ⚠️ **Reporting Violations:** If a player from our server plunders your task, **stay chill**. It is likely a mistake or they do not know the rules. **Report it to our War Lord** (LtHarryBz) by sharing the battle report link. A proportional response will be identified. Do not expect to ash a base in response to a task plunder.
- ⚠️ **Addressing Errors:** You are not perfect. Maybe you plundered a task on 2143. Let LtHarryBz know and private message an apology to the affected Commander.

<span class="section-title">V. DEFENSIVE PLAY: LOCK IN YOUR GAINS</span>

Your tasks are only safe once you collect them.

- **Fast Collection:** Collect your completed tasks **immediately**.
- **The Danger:** If a finished task sits in your menu, players from other servers can plunder it. If you collect quickly, they get nothing. Don't let them steal our server's wealth!
- **Consider setting an alarm** to collect your tasks as soon as they are ready… there is a count down displayed beside the task.
