<span class="section-title">I. WHAT ARE CAPITOL BUFFS?</span>

Capitol Buffs (also known as Titles) are powerful roles that provide massive speed and capacity increases for your base. On Server 2143, these are auto-granted for 5 minutes to anyone who applies once they get to the top of the application queue. Five minutes might not seem long enough to be impactful, but the trick is that you only need the buff active at the exact moment you start a task to lock in the massive time savings.

- ⏱️ **Duration:** You usually hold a title for 5 minutes. If there is no one in line behind you, you keep the title.
- 🛠️ **One-Time Use:** The title buff only applies at the moment a BUILD or RESEARCH is active. The time reduction stays even after the buff expires.
- 📝 **How to Apply:** Click your profile, click the server number, click the Title you want, then hit Apply.
- 🔔 **The Notification:** You will get a game notification when it is your turn.
- ⚡ **The Rule:** You must start your project (or collect your resources) WHILE the buff is active. The time reduction stays even after the buff expires.

<div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #fff; font-family: var(--font-heading); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 10px;">🏗️ Secretary of Development</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Buff:</strong> +50% Building Speed / +25% Research Speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> This is for your "Big Plays." Use it for HQ upgrades or high-level buildings that take multiple days and you will get huge gains. Be ready: Have all resources and requirements met before you join the queue so you can click "Upgrade" when you get the notification.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> This buff will be in high demand on Base Expansion day, but you can easily grab it in the days before and start your major multi-day build.</li>
    </ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #fff; font-family: var(--font-heading); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 10px;">🔬 Secretary of Science</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Buff:</strong> +50% Research Speed / +25% Building Speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Use this specifically for the Tech Center. High-level research can be incredibly expensive and slow; this buff is essential for staying competitive in the arms race.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> This buff will be in high demand on Science Day, you should definitely grab it, but grabbing it a day or two ahead of time to kick off your major research items.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #fff; font-family: var(--font-heading); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 10px;">🍎 Secretary of Interior</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Buff:</strong> +100% increase to Resource Collection (Iron, Food, Coin).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Think of this as your "Morning Harvest." Grab this buff first thing in the morning before you collect the resources floating over your buildings. While you might wait 20 minutes in the queue, the gain on the resources you collect will be much larger than usual.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> To get maximum value from this buff you need to get out of the habit of gathering your base resources constantly through the day. Disabling 'shake-to-collect' (if you have it) might be a good option to avoid accidents.</li>
    </ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #fff; font-family: var(--font-heading); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 10px;">🛡️ Secretary of Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Buff:</strong> Increases to Healing Speed (+20%) and Hospital Capacity (+20%).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> You want to use this if you have a lot of injured troops following a way, or some other unfortunate activity that gets you in trouble. Remember, your troops die when your hospital is full, so the added capacity can be helpful in a pinch.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> It is likely that you will get better value from a strategy of healing in batches while your alliance is active. However, if you want to speed up healing while you are going to be offline, this can be a handy buff.</li>
    </ul>

<div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <h3 style="color: #fff; font-family: var(--font-heading); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 10px;">⚔️ Secretary of Defense</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Buff:</strong> +20% Unit Training Capacity and +20% Training Speed</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> This is a "Mass Production" buff. Because of the +20% Capacity, you can start much larger batches of troops at once. Use this on VS Training Day (Friday) to churn out more troops per click and save on speed-ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Tip:</strong> This works the same for promotions as it does for training. You should combine this with your waterfall method to promote more troops quickly. To maximize impact, size each of you promotion classes to end at around the same time.</li>
    </ul>

<span class="section-title">III. HOW TO USE THE AUTO-GRANT SYSTEM</span>

1. **Prep First:** Open your building or research menu. Ensure you have the resources ready.
2. **Apply:** Go to Your profile, click the server number then select the Title and hit Apply.
3. **Watch the Clock:** You will see a "To-Do" clock (the base clock tower) on your screen showing your place in line. If the wait is going to be long, consider setting a phone alarm to alert you when your time comes.
4. **Execute:** When the notification hits, you have 5 minutes. Start your project immediately. Using a speed up to free up your queue might be necessary depending on your level of readiness.
5. **Finish:** Once the project has started, the time reduction is permanent for that task. You can leave the title for the next person.

<span class="section-title">IV. COMMON MISUNDERSTANDINGS & MISUSE</span>

- **Holding the Title:** A common mistake is thinking you need to hold the title for the entire duration of a 3-day build. You don't. Once you click "Upgrade," the discount is locked in.
- **Wasting the Window:** If you apply but aren't ready to click the button, you block the queue for everyone else. Only apply when you are 100% ready to go.
- **Collect Timing:** For the Secretary of Interior, the buff only works on resources you haven't collected yet. Collecting before you get the buff is a wasted opportunity.
- **No Quitting:** Oddly, you cannot resign. If there is no one waiting in the queue to take the title, you will be stuck with the title. Usually, this is fine, but if you want to move to another title, ask someone in the alliance to relieve you.
- **Weird Math:** The buffs are additive. The work on your editing buffs. For example, the Secretary of Development gives a 50% Construction Speedup. This doesn't mean it cuts the total time in half, but it adds 50% to your existing speed stats.
