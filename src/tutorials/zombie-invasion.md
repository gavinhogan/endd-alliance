<span class="section-title">I. EVENT OVERVIEW</span>

The **Zombie Invasion** (or Defense) is a weekly event where waves of zombies march toward our alliance hive and attack individual bases. The goal is simple: survive as many waves as possible to maximize rewards for yourself and the alliance.

If your base defense fails twice in a row, you are "breached" and the zombies will stop attacking you.

- 📍 **Location is Everything:** You MUST be inside the alliance hive. If your base is isolated, it takes too long for the zombies to reach you, throwing off the event timing and making it impossible for allies to reinforce you.
- 🛡️ **Defense Squads:** Ensure your strongest squad is set on your wall to defend.
- 🩹 **Healing:** Heal your troops continuously. Unlike Marshall Guard, you may need to use small speed-ups if your hospital fills up quickly during the later, harder waves.
- 🤝 **Help Button:** Keep mashing the alliance Help button to assist others with rapid healing.

The core strategy for a successful Zombie Invasion isn't just about surviving yourself—it's about helping weaker alliance members survive to the end so the alliance gets the maximum total point score.

- **Watch the Chat / Base Flames:** If a fellow commander's base catches fire (indicating a failed defense), they are in danger of being eliminated on the next wave.
- **Send Reinforcements:** If you easily defeat your wave, immediately send your 1st or 2nd squad to reinforce a weaker base before their wave arrives.
- **Recall when Needed:** Make sure you recall your squads back to your own base when the massive "Boss" waves (usually waves 10 and 20) spawn, as these will hit everyone extremely hard simultaneously.

*Commander Notes to be completed before finalizing:*
- *[ ] Need to confirm exact wave numbers for Bosses on Server 2143.*
- *[ ] Add specifics on how individual points translate into alliance loot boxes.*
- *[ ] Add guidance on "Bait" bases if ConfuzedCorp uses that strategy.*
